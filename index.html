        <h2 class="c-blue">Fun fact</h2>
        <p><strong>Girls who ride, are some of the most close-knit, foxy, and loyal ladies around and there’s no debating that.</strong> Back in the dark days, women weren't able to ride a motorcycle or get their license. I own multiple rides, and they aren’t just garage ornaments, either. I had to have a motorcycle. My father owned an Indian motorcycle, so he really couldn’t say anything when I wanted one of my own. Riding and music are my life, and I get to do both. Well, I guess you can say I’m lucky enough to be living the dream!.</p>
